This is Exercism's representer for the Ruby track.

It is run with `./bin/run.sh $EXERCISM $PATH_TO_FILES $PATH_FOR_OUTPUT` and will read the source code from `$PATH_TO_FILES` and write a text file with a representation to `$PATH_FOR_OUTPUT`.

For example:

```bash
./bin/run.sh two_fer ~/solution-238382y7sds7fsadfasj23j/ ~/solution-238382y7sds7fsadfasj23j/output
```
