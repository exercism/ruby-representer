# Synopsis:
# Test the representer Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# solutions with an expected output.
# The representer Docker image is built automatically.

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected representation files against the actual 
# representation files generated by the test runner Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

# Stop executing when a command returns a non-zero return code
set -e

# Build the Docker image
docker build --rm -t exercism/ruby-representer .

# Run the Docker image using the settings mimicking the production environment
docker run \
    --rm \
    --network none \
    --read-only \
    --mount type=bind,src="${PWD}/tests",dst=/opt/representer/tests \
